Suppose, you have 2 LEDs connected to Pin 0, 3 of Port C of ATmega32.
 You also have three inputs (logic state from Proteus, say x, y, z) and are connected to Pin 0, 2, 4 of Port B, respectively. 
Initially, the two LEDs are turned off.
 You also have a push-button connected to ATmega32 as an active low switch, 
and when the button is pressed, these 2 LEDs will show (in binary) the number of active bits of our three inputs x, y, z.
